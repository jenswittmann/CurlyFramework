## Modular CSS toolkit based on OOCSS principles

Basscss is a lightweight collection of base element styles, utilities, layout modules, and color styles designed for speed, performance, and scalability.

## Features

### Designed for Design
With simple, humanized naming conventions,
Basscss is quick to internalize and easy to wrap your head around,
while striking a balance between consistency and flexibility.

### Responsive by Default
The web is inherently flexible, Basscss doesn't break that tradition
and provides lightweight solutions to design for all devices.

### Unobtrusive
Basscss doesn't dictate what your site should look like.
With extensible base styles and variables for typography, white space, breakpoints, and UI elements,
customizing the look and feel is easy.

### Mix and Match
With modular styles that work like building blocks,
Basscss provides a foundation of reusable and inter-operable styles
for greater freedom when designing in the browser.
