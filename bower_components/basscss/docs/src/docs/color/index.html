  The word <i>color</i> is used loosely here to describe
  the surface-level aspects of a design, including
  colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows and other properties
  that are decorative and highly likely to change over time.
  Basscss includes a suite of color utilities as a starting point.
  Use these as a guide for creating your own styles.
